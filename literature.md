{Conesa:2016du} have a nice RNA-seq review, that includes various QC issues, as well as a discussion of advanced methods such as single-cell analyses, small RNAs and fusion transcripts

{Ameur:2011jy} find lots of unprocessed mRNA in fetal brain samples, and show transcriptional splicing, where introns are removed during transcription. The signature for this is a saw-tooth pattern where the 5' ends of large introns have a lot of read data, but the 3' ends don't because the introns are removed as soon as the 3' end is transcribed. This was also confirmed with PCR across splice sites. I think this mostly indicates a high level of mRNA turn-over and high levels of active transcription. 

- De novo splice junctions were detected using version 1.3.2 of SplitSeek
    - this tool appears to be a bit rubbish
this is just a test
